# ThanhVu (Vu) Nguyen ðŸ‘‹



ðŸŒ± I am an Associate Professor in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.gmu.edu) at George Mason University. My research is in Formal Methods and Software Engineering. My current work focuses on the the formal analysis of software and AI systems.

 I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of New Mexico-Albuquerque](https://cs.unm.edu) and completed a postdoc at the [University of Maryland-College Park](https://cs.umd.edu). Before joining Mason, I was at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu). Outside of academia, I have worked at the [Naval Research Laboratory](https://www.nrl.navy.mil) and [Lockheed Martin](https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/research-labs/advanced-technology-labs.html).

âš¡**Fun fact**: I came to the US as a refugee from Vietnam when I was 11. Initially I was in Hawaii and relocated to Pennsylvania, where I grew up. I met my wife on a Southwest flight. We have three children, all  born while I was an assistant prof. in Nebraska. We are now living in the Northern Virginia/DC area.
