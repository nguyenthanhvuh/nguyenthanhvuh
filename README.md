## [Brief Bio](https://dynaroars.github.io/nguyenthanhvuh/files/bio-nguyen.txt)  (e.g., for talks)

<details>
<summary><kbd>More details âš¡</kbd></summary>

  **Life**: I immigrated from Vietnam to the US when I was 11 (old enough to remember and preserve my Vietnamese culture and language, but young enough to embrace and absorb the American way of life). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from [Penn State-University Park](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) and my M.S. from [Penn State-Harrisburg](https://hbg.psu.edu/), where I was advised by [Thang Bui](https://h3turing.cs.hbg.psu.edu/~bui/). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of New Mexico-Albuquerque](https://www.cs.unm.edu/), where I was mentored by [Stephanie Forrest](https://profsforrest.github.io/homepage/) and [Deepak Kapur](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~kapur). After finishing my Ph.D., I did a two-year postdoc at the [University of Maryland-College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), working with Jeff Foster at [PLUM@UMD](https://plum-umd.github.io/). Before joining [George Mason](https://cs.gmu.edu/), I was at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/). During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at the [Naval Research Laboratory](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/) and [Lockheed Martin](https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/research-labs/advanced-technology-labs.html).

  **Work**: I met my wife on a Southwest flight. We have three children, all of whom were born while I was an assistant prof. at UNL.
