## [Brief Bio](https://dynaroars.github.io/nguyenthanhvuh/files/bio-nguyen.txt)  (for talks, etc)

<details>
<summary><kbd>More details</kbd></summary>

**Life**: I immigrated from Vietnam to the US when I was 11 (old enough to remember and preserve my Vietnamese culture and language, but young enough to embrace and absorb the American way of life). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Penn State-University Park and my M.S. from Penn State-Harrisburg, where I was advised by Thang Bui. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of New Mexico-Albuquerque, where I was mentored by Stephanie Forrest and Deepak Kapur. After finishing my Ph.D., I did a two-year postdoc at the University of Maryland-College Park, working with Jeff Foster at PLUM@UMD. Before joining George Mason, I was at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at the Naval Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.

**Work**: I met my wife on a Southwest flight. We have three children, all of whom were born while I was an assistant prof. at UNL.
